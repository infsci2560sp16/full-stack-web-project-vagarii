                    <p>I’m 27 and female. Since I was 21, I’ve been away at least once a year, for anything from 3 nights to 9 months, alone. I also go on trips with friends, but I make a point of regularly going solo.</p>

                    <p>When alone, I’ve been met with various reactions, but they tend to fall into two broad camps:</p>

                    <p>1. Awesome, that must be really fun! (Wide eyes, look of interest, wants to hear stories)</p>

                    <p>2.Really? You’re on your own?! Why?? (Raised eyebrows, expression of slight distrust, thinks I’m weird)</p>

                    <p>Both are totally valid. In fact, depending on what’s happened that day, either can feel completely (sometimes painfully) justified.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Why?</h2>

                    <p>It’s rare that I forge a friendship with someone from the second camp. And, if they get me on a bad day, their reaction can feel like a gentle kick in the stomach.</p>

                    <p>As I look to the year ahead, and think about the trips I’ll inevitably make alone, I’m offering myself a small reminder of why it’s necessary and important to me. Just in case I need a little push.</p>

                    <blockquote>Seven reasons I travel solo</blockquote>

                    <p>I can wander off. Stay. Go. Change my mind. Follow a whim. I don’t have anyone else’s preferences, needs or feelings to bear in mind and carefully balance against my own. I can be utterly selfish and not feel bad about it. For most human adults — typically surrounded by and attuned to the needs of children, parents, friends, colleagues, clients, pets — this is a strange and wonderful luxury.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Because I can see what ‘me’ really looks like</h2>

                    <p>With no one around who knows me, I’m in my own little social vacuum. Stripping out the group norms of my social circles — those silent rules of engagement, shared experiences and in-jokes that quietly guide our day-to-day interactions — leaves nothing left except… me. Sometimes I like what I see there, sometimes I question it, and sometimes it comes as a surprise. Either way, exposure feels interesting and important.</p>

                    <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-responsive" src="img/bg-header.jpg" alt="">
                    </a>
                    <span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span>

                    <p>It’s seriously noticeable how much more readily people will approach someone who’s sitting alone and strike up conversation. I’ve chewed coca leaves with a Peruvian social activist, played guitar with a Chilean musician, shared my journal with a Chinese mother-of-two, and been taught to surf by an Australian farmhand. I don’t believe any of those moments would have happened — or certainly felt like such rich, colourful moments of connection— if I hadn’t been sitting by myself.</p>

                    <p>I’ve learned that the quickest way to see the best of humanity is to make yourself vulnerable. I’ve found myself in hot (make that cold) water more times than I’d like, and every time been rescued by a warm-hearted and generous stranger. Regular reminders of why I should have faith in humanity sure is good for the soul.</p>
